Metasploit
=============================================

Metasploit Overview:
====================

Metasploit is more than just a ‘tool’, it was envisioned as a Framework
where tools, exploits, payloads and other hacker-related things would be
able to exist, allowing a penetration tester/hacker/researcher to focus
on what they wanted to do instead of having to cobble together many
different scripts.

Metasploit has been growing in size since its first release in 2003,
first built by a man named HD Moore using some basic perl scripts.
Metasploit 2.0 was released in October 2004, by Moore and a larger team
and has been expanding ever since with contributions from the larger
hacker-centric community.

Metasploit is essentially a console where many different modules work
together to allow a pentester to set common components up and then
execute code against potentially vulnerable targets.

The exploits within Metasploit are many and varied – you can attack
anything from a Mainframe to a Smartphone with a few simple commands.
And the exploits and payloads within Metasploit are configurable and can
be updated whenever there are newly released vulnerabilities.
